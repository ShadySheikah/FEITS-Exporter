# FEITS Exporter
Fire Emblem: If Text Simulator and Exporter

Behaves similarly to the original FEITS, but serves more specifically for editing dialogue lines. It lacks the portrait generator of the original, but includes some nifty new features to make up for it:

-Line-by-line edit hides everything but the currently-previewed line to make editing easier.

-Real-time preview lets you check how a line looks without reloading the entire script.

-All the code is hidden from view to allow you to focus on the lines themselves.

-Editor now supports newlines. You can use the enter key to position text, and FEITSE will add the \n marker automatically.

If you'd like access to the code, you can still edit lines directly.

When you're finished editing, the Export function will compile the lines back into one script formatted identically to the original, with your changes included.
Character count makes it easy to see how many characters your script contains.
